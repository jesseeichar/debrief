/**
 * Implements the runnable interface and updates the SampleXYDataset.  This gives the event
 * notification mechanism in JFreeChart a run to make sure it works.
 *
 * WARNING 1 : There are likely to be problems with accessing datasets from more than one thread,
 * so don't use this code for anything other than the demo!
 * <P>
 * WARNING 2 : Updating the dataset this way 'animates' the chart - but JFreeChart is not designed
 * for the production of animated charts.  For fast animations, you need a chart that draws to
 * a bitmap, in order to optimise the screen updates.  But JFreeChart draws to an abstract
 * drawing surface (Graphics2D), which brings many benefits, but also means that we cannot implement
 * any performance tricks when the screen updates because we cannot guarantee which pixels are
 * rendered by the Graphics2D pipeline...
