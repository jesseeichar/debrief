 * All datasets are required to support the DatasetChangeEvent mechanism by allowing listeners to
 * register and receive notification of any changes to the dataset.
 * <P>
 * In addition, all datasets must belong to one (and only one) DatasetGroup.  The group object
 * maintains a reader-writer lock which provides synchronised access to the datasets in
 * multi-threaded code.
