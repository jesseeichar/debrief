         <b>ASSET uses a workspace to contain your data.  Data in this workspace is stored in Project folders.  So you need to create a folder.  This is also a convenient time to integrate some sample data and check that you have a valid XML editor</b>

      <description>
         The <b>Navigator</b> window is your view of your data files.  It should be visible at the top-left of ASSET.  If it isn&apos;t open it via Window/Show View/Navigator, or by using &apos;Click to perform&apos; below.

      <description>
         When first opened, workspaces are typically empty. You create a project that contains either your data files, or a number of links to existing data.  So, have a look in your Navigator and see if there are any folders (projects) listed there.

		<description>If your navigator is empty, then yes, you need to create a project. Right-click in the Navigator view, and select &apos;Project...&apos; from the &apos;New&apos; sub-menu.  The New Project wizard will open. From the &apos;General&apos; folder, select Project, and then press &apos;Next&apos;. Now just enter a name for your project (this could be your name or the name of the current simulation exercise). Lastly press the &apos;Finish&apos; button, and you will see the new project in your workspace.  Or use the &apos;Click to run&apos; link below to quickly open the New project window.

		<description>Right-click on your current project in the Navigator view, then select &apos;Folder&apos; from the &apos;New&apos; sub-menu.  The New Folder wizard will open.  Instead of creating a fresh child folder to store our data, we&apos;re going to link to an existing folder.  So, whilst still in the New Folder Wizard, click the &apos;Advanced&apos; button to display the Advanced options.   Next, click on the &apos;Link to folder in the file system&apos;, and navigate to the &apos;sample_data&apos; folder that&apos;s contained within your ASSET installation folder, then clicking on &quot;Finish&quot; to, erm, Finish.  The &apos;Click to perform&apos; button below will open the folder dialog for you - though you&apos;ll have to specify the parent project for the folder.</description>

      <description>
         <b>ASSET uses data files that adhere to the XML data standard. XML is easily read and manipulated by computers, but can be a little verbose and fiddly when edited by humans. That&apos;s why we use an XML Editor that hides some of the fiddly details</b>

            label="The Oxygen xml editor is a mature application that&apos;s available both in standalone form and as an Eclipse plugin (Eclipse is the &apos;framework&apos; that ASSET is built on top of).   We&apos;re distributing the Oxygen xml editor with ASSET but since it&apos;s a commercial application there are unfortunately licensing issues to resolve - specifically, it requires you to enter license details before you can run it.">

In the Open-With drop-down of the popup menu you should see &lt;b&gt;Oxygen XML Editor&lt;/b&gt;. If it&apos;s there, you&apos;re fine.  If it isn&apos;t, then you should see your ASSET maintainer to get Oxygen installed. Of course, if you&apos;re an XML wizard you may choose to run through the tutorial in plain text mode - but I don&apos;t think you&apos;re reached level 3 geek-dom yet.">
