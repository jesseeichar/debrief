         <b>In this part of the tutorial you are going to create a new, empty scenario file - then populate it with sample data.  The scenario will describe a frigate looking for a fishing vessel</b>

      <description>
         Some thinking first.  Have a look in your navigator view, and decide on a location for your new scenario file.  It isn&apos;t all that tidy to put it into the existing AssetData sample data folder, so you could create a new folder in the root of your project (by right-clicking on the root folder and selecting &apos;New Folder&apos;.  The new folder could be called &apos;trials&apos;, for example.

      <description>
         Now that you know where to put the new scenario, right click on the parent folder and select <b>New \ Other...</b>.  From the tree of available wizards, select &apos;XML File&apos; from the &apos;XML&apos; folder. Now press &apos;Next&apos;.  On the next page of the wizard, provide a filename for the new scenario - how about <b>trial1.asset</b>.  <b>Note:</b> ASSET runs more smoothly if you name scenarios with the <b>.asset</b> suffix. <br/>On the next page, select  <b>Create XML file from an XML template</b>, then indicate that you want a  new Asset Scenario.  The file will then open.

         title="Admire the editor">
      <description>Your new scenario may probably open in <b>Source</b> view.  This is ok for geeks, but you may find it easier to use the tree oriented view.  If you are in the <b>Source</b> view, switch to the graphical view by clicking on the <b>Design</b> tab at the foot of the editor pane.  

Now your in the graphic view, experiment with expanding the <b>Scenario</b>.  

By the way, if you look at ASSET&apos;s <b>Outline</b> view (or click the arrow below) you&apos;ll see an outline view of the current sceanrio.

ASSET&apos;s Properties view is also useful when working with scenario files.  Open the properties view by selecting Window/Show View/Properties.  Now, you are able to edit the attributes for any element selected in the editor view.ditor view.

         Youve got big dreams? You want fame? Well, fame costs.  And right here is where you start paying in sweat.
<br/>
Well, not quite, but you do have to start typing now.  So, open the Scenario element, and give the scenario a name &apos;Cheat sheet scenario&apos;.  If you switch to the properties view you&apos;ll see the other attributes needed: <b>Created</b> and <b>StartTime</b>. ASSET expects dates in the ISO 8601 date standard: <b>2010-01-12T12:13:14Z</b>.  Put in today&apos;s date as the created attribute, and any old date as the StartTime attribute.
<br/>
Next, specify how far in time the scenario should step forward (<b>StepTime</b>). Have a go at five minutes: <b>Minutes</b> are the <b>Unit</b> and 5 is the <b>Value</b>.
<br/>
Read more about the attributes of the scenario element using the help link near this text.

         title="Specify Environment">
      <description>
         Now we have to give the scenario an environment.  Do this by right-clicking on the <b>Scenario</b> and selecting <b>Add child</b> / <b>Environment</b>.  Also, give it a name - how about <b>Atlantic Summer</b>.  Play with the sea state and atmospheric attenuation if you wish.
<br/> You can learn more about the role of the attributes in the attached help link.

      <description>
         Next, we have to put something into the scenario.  Right-click on <b>Participants</b> and select <b>Surface</b>.  If you open up the new participant, you&apos;ll see that the compulsary elements have already been included.   Now, give the vessel a name, <b>Fisher One</b> should do.

         title="Tidy the participant">
      <description>
         Now it&apos;s tome to flesh out a little more of the fishing vessel.  Start off with the category - indicate that it&apos;s a <b>FISHING_VESSEL</b> of the <b>GREEN</b> force and it travels in the <b>SURFACE</b> environment.
<br/>
We&apos;ll leave the sensor fit empty, but we should give it an initial status.  Set the <b>Course</b> to 30, then <b>Fuel</b> to 100.  Now set the location to <b>Lat</b> of 50 and <b>Long</b> of <b>-8</b>.  Lastly, specify a <b>Speed</b> of 6 Knots.

         title="Specify the movement characteristics">
      <description>
         Next up we have to inform ASSET regarding how the fishing vessel performs in the SurfaceMovementCharacteristics.  Enter the following data = <b>Name:</b> 9m Fisherman, <b>FuelUsageRate</b> 0.0001, <b>MinSpeed</b>0 Kts, <b>MaxSpeed</b>12 Kts, <b>AccelerationRate</b> 1 kt/sec, <b>DeceleratonRate</b> 1 kt/sec, <b>TurningCircle</b>  400 metres.

         title="Provide participant behaviour">
      <description>
         Next, we&apos;re going to indicate what the fishing vessel is up to.  We&apos;re going to make it travel to a fishing ground, and then wander around it.  Do this by right-clicking on the <b>Surface</b> element and selecting <b>Sequence</b> from the Add-Child sub-menu.  See the help link (right) for more on the Sequence behaviour. Name this sequence element &quot;Southern Trawl&quot;.  Also, mark the Sequence behaviour as being &apos;Active&apos; (by setting <b>IsActive</b> true from the properties window).

         title="Next comes the transit.">
      <description>
         Right-click on the Sequence element and select <b>Transit</b> from the Add-child drop-down.  Name this transit as &apos;Travel to fishing grounds&apos;, set <b>Looping</b> to false, and fill in the WorldPath&apos;s location as <b>Lat</b> 50.4 and <b>Long</b> -8.8.  Also specify the transit speed as 9 knots.

      <description>
         Right-click on the <b>Transit</b> element and select <b>Wander</b> from the <b>Add After</b> drop-down.  Fill in the Wander element by specifying the name as &apos;morning trawl&apos;, a speed of 9 knots, the location to 50.4, -8.8.  Specify the height as zero, and set the range to 12 nautical miles.

         title="Now for the warship">
      <description>
         Next we&apos;re going to add a warship to the scenario.  Right-click on <b>Participants</b> and select <b>Surface</b> from &apos;add child&apos;.  We&apos;ll name this T23. Next, set its category as a Blue, Surface, Frigate.
      </description>

   <item
         title="Gvie it a sensor">
      <description>
         To keep things simple we&apos;re going to give the Frigate a very simple cookie-cutter sensor, that blindly checks the range to the target against its detection range attribute.  So, right-click on <b>SensorFit</b> and add a <b>PlainCookieSensor</b>.  Set the detection range of the sensor to 3 nautical miles.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
         title="Locate the warship">
      <description>
         Next, we&apos;ve got to tell the warship where it is.  Go into the <b>Status</b> element and set the location to 50 degs of latitude, and -10 degs of longitude.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
         title="Specify the warship movement details">
      <description>
         Next, expand the <b>SurfaceMovementCharacteristics</b> item to specify how the warship moves.  I&apos;ve been finding this easier to do in the <b>Source</b> view for the editor - switch by clicking on the tab at the foot of the editor page.  Give the Frigate a max speed of 12 kts, accel and decel rates of 1 kt per second, and a turning circle of 300m.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
         title="Direct the warship">
      <description>
         To create the placeholder for the Warship&apos;s behaviour, right-click on it and add a <b>Waterfall</b> behaviour.<br/>We&apos;re going to have the warship wandering around the same body of water as the fisherman, so go into the <b>Source</b> view and copy the <b>Wander</b> behaviour, and paste it into the <b>Waterfall</b> of the Frigate.  Back in the <b>Design</b> view, change the name of this Wander behaviour to <b>Count fishing vessels</b>.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
         title="Done">
      <description>
         And we&apos;re done. We&apos;ve got a valid scenario that describes what our fishing vessel is up to.
