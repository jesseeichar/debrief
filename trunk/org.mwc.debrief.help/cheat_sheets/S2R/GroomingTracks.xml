		<description>This cheat-sheet will lead you through grooming some </description>
	</intro>
	<item title="Check Navigator is open">
		<description>In the top left hand corner of Debrief you should find the Navigator window. If
			is isn&apos;t there, select &quot;Navigator&quot; from Debrief&apos;s Window/Show View menu. In the
			navigator, you should have a linked directory to sample data, either from a previous
			Debrief installation, or from within the &apos;Sample_data&apos; folder in the installation directory of this fresh one.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="View sample data">
		<description>In the Navigator, expand the folder that contains your existing Debrief files
			(either REP or XML). REP files are flagged with a Debrief icon. </description>
	</item>
	<item title="Check import mode">
		<description>For this tutorial we need to ensure that the data track is imported in Over the Ground mode.  To check the import mode, click on the Preferences item from the Window menu.  The Default track mode selector is in the CMAP preferences. Check that Ask users selected - so that you can be confident of the mode in which the data is to be imported. </description>
	</item>
	<item title="Drag in sample data">
		<description>Drag the tracks.rep file from your the S2R_demo folder of the Navigator view onto the plot. The plot and any
			associated views will promptly update. As the REP file is dragged in, you&apos;ll be asked
			whether you wish to import the data in Over The Ground (OTG) or Dead Reckoning (DR)
			mode. Select OTG for this tutorial</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Plots loaded">
		<description>There you are, your track data is now on the plot. In this (fictional) example, you have your blue ownship track shown to the South. Unfortunately this track has a period of missing data.  You've obtained this track section from another source, but its got an offset applied</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Get in the ballpark">
		<description>We'll start off by moving this rogue track segment down to the right region. To do this, click on the 'Drag whole feature' toolbar button: it's a cursor arrow with a rectangle to its top-right. Now move your hand-shaped cursor over the 'rogue' green track. You'll see your hand turn green as it passes over something that can be dragged.  When its green over the rogue track, click the mouse and drag it down near the remainder of the track (Hint, put it just below the 'g' of the blue track title.  Trust me, I know where it's going to go...).</description>
	</item>	
	<item title="Fit to window">
		<description>Now click on the 'Fit to Window' toolbar button, it's the green diagonal arrows. The plot will now zoom in and you'll see the data in more detail</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Display symbol data">
		<description>It would now be useful to show position markers/symbols. To do this, either right-click on the blue track, or right-click on 'Track:Frigate' in the Layer Manager.  From the popup menu, navigate to the 'Frigate' drop-down menu 1/2 way down - then select a Symbol Frequency of 1 second.  </description>
