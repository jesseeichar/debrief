         With ever-increasing data rates from multiple recording systems it is easy for an analysis plot to become swamped.  Debrief NG provides tools to reduce the volume and type of data displayed.  This tutorial will lead you through the management of large volumes of data.

         Before you can link in existing data, you need to define a project for your work.  This is a parent folder within which your links are stored.  If your Navigator window is empty, you must follow the &quot;Generating a project&quot; cheat-sheet accessed from the Help/Cheat Sheets menu.
