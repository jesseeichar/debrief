	<intro>
		<description>Debrief's New Plot Wizard is quite effective at providing you with a ready-formatted backdrop to your analysis, but it doesn't load your data for you.  Here we're going to load some existing tracks to assist your getting started.

	<item title="Check Navigator is open">
		<description>In the top left hand corner of Debrief you should find the Navigator window.  If is isn't there, select "Navigator" from Debrief's Window/Show View menu.  In the navigator, you should have a linked directory to sample data, either from a previous Debrief installation, or from within this fresh one.</description>

		<description>In the Navigator, expand the folder that contains your existing Debrief files (either REP or XML).  Valid Debrief files are flagged with a Debrief icon.  See the help link for this step (the Question mark icon) to read about the two file types. </description>

       title="Drag in a simple track">
		<description>Drag a REP track from your Navigator onto the plot. The <b>boat1.rep</b> file is a simple starting point.  The plot and any associated views will promptly update.  When REP files are dragged in, you may be asked whether you wish to import the data in Over The Ground (OTG) or Dead Reckoning (DR) mode. See help link (?) fro this step for more detail.</description>

		<description>There you are, your track data is now on the plot.  Note, tracks can't only be dragged from the Navigator. If you arrange your windows correctly you can drag tracks in directly from Windows Explorer.</description>
