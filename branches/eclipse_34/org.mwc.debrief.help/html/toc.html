<h1>Table of Contents</h1>

To keep up to speed with what has been happening with Debrief, you can either view the 
high-level overview of what's new, or get down into the nitty gritty of what files 
have been changed (and for what reason) in the <a href="history\statcvs\short\index.html">Version Control log</a>.
The version control log is certainly the authoritative reference for what has been
happening.  It's produced automatically, contains exhaustive coverage of every 
feature change and bug-fix.
