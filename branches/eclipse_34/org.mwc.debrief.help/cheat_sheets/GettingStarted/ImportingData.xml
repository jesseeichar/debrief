	<intro>
		<description>Debrief's New Plot Wizard is quite effective at providing you with a ready-formatted backdrop to your analysis, but it doesn't load your data for you.  Here we're going to load some existing tracks to assist your getting started.
		</description>
	</intro>
	<item title="Check Navigator is open">
		<description>In the top left hand corner of Debrief you should find the Navigator window.  If is isn't there, select "Navigator" from Debrief's Window/Show View menu.  In the navigator, you should have a linked directory to sample data, either from a previous Debrief installation, or from within this fresh one.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="View sample data">
		<description>In the Navigator, expand the folder that contains your existing Debrief files (either REP or XML).  REP files are flagged with a Debrief icon. </description>
	</item>
	<item title="Drag in some tracks">
		<description>Drag one or more tracks from your Navigator onto the plot.  The plot and any associated views will promptly update.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Done">
		<description>There you are, your track data is now on the plot.  Note, tracks can't only be dragged from the Navigator. If you arrange your windows correctly you can drag tracks in directly from Windows Explorer.</description>
