/** The sole purpose of this class is to workaround a monstrously poor
 design decision at Sun to add a method to the java.awt.Graphics class
 between JDK1.1 and JDK1.2.  Usually, adding a method to an abstract
 class is not a problem, derived classes can easily add dummy methods
 to handle both the old base class and the new base class.

 Unfortunately, the method that was added takes an argument of 
 a type that is only present in JDK1.2, so we cannot just add
 a method in the derived class and expect everything to compile
 under both JDK1.1 and JDK1.2.

 The evil workaround is to have two files, PtolemyGraphics1_1.java
 and PtolemyGraphics1_2.java and to copy the appropriate file to
 PtolemyGraphics.java, depending on the version of the JDK.

 This is an evil, unportable, and nasty hack, which would not be
 necessary if Java had a preprocessor, or Sun had not added this 
 bogus method. :-)
