<h1>Getting started with Debrief</h1>
<p>Welcome to the documentation for Debrief.   Debrief has been produced by the Maritime Warfare   Centre in Portsmouth UK, to support the analysis and reporting of maritime   tactical exercises. </p>
<p>In December 2000 the Maritime Warfare Centre decided to give Debrief an Open Source status, opening the application   and its source code into the public domain. </p>
<p>Debrief has been made Open Source to   facilitate its wider use, encouraging adoption of standard file formats,   presentation and practices between analysis agencies. </p>
