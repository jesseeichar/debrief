			<intro>In comparison with prior versions of Debrief, Debrief NG introduces the concept of a Workspace - a central repository for your assorted analysis-related documents.  Within this workspace your work is grouped into individual projects: thus you can quickly switch between concurrent analysis tasks.  Debrief's provision of projects alows you to quickly drag and drop Debrief data-files and plots.</intro>
			<onCompletion>Right, Debrief now knows where to find your data.  In the next series of steps you will load and examine some data.</onCompletion>
