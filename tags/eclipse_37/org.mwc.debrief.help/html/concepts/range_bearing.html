<h1>Range & Bearing measurement</h1>
<p>Ranges and bearings within Debrief are calculated according to the Rhumb-Line   formulae, taken from the Admiralty Manual of Navigation, Volume 2, BR 45(2),   Revised 1973, pages 5-11.</p>
<p>The Rhumb-line calculation is used both for the display of measured   range-bearing and for the projection of data onto the monitor. Briefly, the to   convert from real-world to screen coordinates the following procedure is   followed:</p>
<DIV>
  <OL type="1">
    <LI>
      <p>Determine the area represented by the current viewed data in world   coordinates</p>
    <LI>
      <p>Determine the centre of this data area - this is used as the origin of the   data</p>
    <LI>
      <p>For each data point to be plotted, find its range and bearing from the   origin</p>
    <LI>
      <p>Convert this range and bearing into a delta-x and delta-y in screen   coordinates</p>
    <LI>
      <p>Produce a data point in screen coordinates by adding these deltas to the   centre of the screen</p>
    </LI>
  </OL>

This is negligible in data areas near the equator or   where only a small area is covered (less than a couple of hundred nautical   miles). With greater data areas, and nearer the poles, the effects are more   noticeable, however. </p></TD>

  </DIV>
  <p>A line on the earth's surface whihc cuts all meridians at the same angle is   called a rhumb line.</p>
  <p>With his knowledge of the distance along a parallel of latitude and the   departure between two places, the navigator can find the course he must steer in   order to follow the rhumb line joining the two places, and also the distance he   will travel along whilst doing so. In the figure below  FT is the rhumb-line divided into a large number of equal parts FA,   AB, BC... </p>

    <DIV></DIV>
  </DIV>
  <p>Af, Ba, Cb... are the arcs of parallels drawn through A, B, C ... and the   angles at f, a, b ..., are therefore at right-angles. If the divisions of FT are   made sufficiently small, the triangles FaF, ABa, BbB ... are themselves small   enough to be treated as plane triangles. Also, since the course angle at F, A,   B, C, ... remains constant by the definition of a rhumb-line, these smal   triangles are equal.</p>

    </DIV>
  </DIV>
  <p>By the term <EM>short-distance sailing</EM> is   meant the following of a rhumb-line track for a distance not greater than 600'.   Within this limiting distance, the navigator can obtain all he wants to know   about the track from the three formulae: </p>
  <PRE>              departure = d.long cos (mean latitude)   (1)  departure = distance sin (course)     (2)  d.lat = distance cos (course)         (3)    The course is given by (2) divided by (3). Thus:  departure / d.lat = tan (course)  </PRE>
